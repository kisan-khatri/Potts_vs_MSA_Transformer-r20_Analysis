This is a simple example which choose 1000 columns. I have provided every details in the other directory for other figures which has been reported in the MS. You can use those directory directly. 

Install Mi3-GPU and all necessary packages from there.

You need to run: sbatch run_hom.sh
            python r20_plot.py


But, all necessary files are provided. So, when you install Mi3-GPU and all necessary packages (see details in the Mi3-GPU link I have provided) , and run these two commands, you will see r20 plot.

Thank you.

Note: For details, please go to Figure3 folder.
