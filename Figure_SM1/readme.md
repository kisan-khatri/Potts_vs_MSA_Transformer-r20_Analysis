This is a summplemental figure 1. It is the plot between two body connected correlation.

We have used all the filtered MSA for RR domain (MSA of 6K sequences), generated MSAs of same length from two models, and estimated two body statistics of the training and generated MSA, and made this plot. For details, see supplemental information.

Thank you.
