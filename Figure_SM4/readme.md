This is the plot for entropy per position or conservation per position. For this , we need to calculate the univariate marginal of the each MSA , and can make this plot.

The purpose of this is to see how the amino acid residues are conserved in the MSA before training and after training for all three models.

Please see the supplemental information for details.

Thank you.
